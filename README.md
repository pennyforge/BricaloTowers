# BricaloTowers
Python script to create accurately placed but random piles of randomly selected Lego bricks as ,ldr LDRAW files
This is the original script that I used when designing the brick piles for the bricalo website www.brickalo.com Each .ldr LDRAW file contains a number of randomly selected bricks that are accurately positioned so that each brick correctly interlocks with at least one other brick.
Runs in Python 2.7
