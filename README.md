# BricaloTowers
brickaloTowers.py is a Python script to create accurately placed but random piles of randomly selected Lego bricks as ,ldr LDRAW files
This is the original script that I used when designing the brick piles for the bricalo website www.brickalo.com Each .ldr LDRAW file contains a number of randomly selected bricks that are accurately positioned so that each brick correctly interlocks with at least one other brick.
Runs in Python 2.7 under Windows and you need to have a copy of the LDRAW parts folder installed here..."C:\LDraw\Parts"
